        After a car accident destroys his hands and hinders his ability to perform surgery,
        he searches the globe for a way to repair them and encounters the Ancient One. After
        becoming one of the old Sorcerer Supreme\'s students, he becomes a practitioner of both
        the mystical arts as well as martial arts. Along with knowing many powerful spells, he
        has a costume with two mystical objects - the Cloak of Levitation and Eye of Agamotto
